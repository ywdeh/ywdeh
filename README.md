### ☔ Hey there!</br>
I've known as Hedwy. I'm using code and design to bring up to life cozy and immersive ideas for people and myself to enjoy.

In 2026, I'm working on several projects:
- **Wintertale**
  Game-related community, the project itself is built on idea of making comfortable and noise-free environment for the players.
  Development process includes art (illustrations), Discord app development and in-game scripting.
  </br>*Public repos are not available for now.*
- **Patter**
  Web application aimed to create a customizable space with pre-defined sound and visual effects for immersive writing sessions.
  </br>*Public repos are not available for now.*
